The SCA Cloud Cohort 3 has exceeded my expectations. My journey in Cloud Computing has been interesting. I was paired with a friend in 2021 for a project in a class, and we were instructed to choose a topic from the list of options to research and present. I had no idea what to do, but my friend suggested that we researched on cloud computing. It's funny because I first learned about it then. So, we conducted study and submitted it. She informed me that she majored in it and was a member of the SCA Cloud Cohort 1 during the Covid-19 lockdown while we were conducting our research. </p>
                
                <p class="text-justify" style="margin-top:17px;color:rgb(59,62,65);font-family:Roboto, sans-serif;font-weight:400;">I was genuinely curious. I was particularly drawn to it because it contained very little to no coding. I wasn't sure what to pursue fter college at this point, and it didn't seem like the solution had emerged . I read and researched on Cloud Computing and Devops Engineering ater the project. A few months later, I began studying for the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam; regrettably, I failed to make the cut-off. When she informed me that SCA had launched the third cloud cohort during the ASUU strike, I was overjoyed because I knew it would be my introduction to the world of cloud computing. I wasn't let down. The third cohort of the SCA Cloud has been a boon. And I'll make sure to tell everyone about the SCA Cloud Cohort's magnificence.</p>
